"""
vLLM Patching Module - Enables CUDA IPC shared memory for single-copy training.

This module patches vLLM's GPUModelRunner to:
1. Call share_memory_() on model weights after loading
2. Export CUDA IPC handles to vllm_bridge_config.json
3. Enable the trainer to attach to vLLM's tensors directly

The result: ONE copy of model weights in GPU memory, shared between
vLLM (inference) and the trainer (gradient updates).

Usage:
    # Set environment BEFORE importing
    import os
    os.environ["VLLM_ENABLE_SHARED_WEIGHTS"] = "1"

    # Import and apply patches BEFORE importing vllm
    from example_trainer.vllm_patching import apply_patches
    apply_patches()

    # Then import vllm normally
    from vllm import AsyncLLM
