"""
Checkpoint saving utilities for GRPO trainer.

Handles saving model checkpoints for different training modes:
- Full model checkpoints (legacy and shared_vllm modes)
- LoRA adapter checkpoints

IMPORTANT: For shared_vllm mode, the model parameters are VIEWS into vLLM's
fused tensors (qkv_proj, gate_up_proj). This module handles unfusing them
back to HuggingFace format for safe checkpoint saving.
